# SPRenderAnalysisManager
🚀 A simple tool what can help analyze page render time in Objective-C program.

😎 There are two interesting 'Prirates' in this tool:
* 🏴‍☠️SPRunloopTimersPirate
* 🏴‍☠️SPGCDTimersPirate

They can stop all timers at the 'kill' moment, enjoy it!

Thanks [fishhook](https://github.com/facebook/fishhook), it is so cool and very helpful.
